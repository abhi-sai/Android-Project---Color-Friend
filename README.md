# Android-Project - Color-Friend

### What is Color Friend?

Color Friend is an app built to assist color blind people.

### What are its features?

- Ishihara Color Vision Test
- Color Detection
- Daltonization

### Ishihara test

Ishihara test is a color perception test for red-green color deficiencies. It was named after its designer, Dr. Shinobu Ishihara, a professor at the University of Tokyo, who first published his tests in 1917.

Note: These tests are not completely conclusive. Please consult a doctor if needed.

### Color Detection

Just point your camera at an object and touch it, the bar at the bottom will display the color of the object. This functionality has been implemented with the help of the OpenCV Library.

OpenCV: http://opencv.org/

### Daltonization

Daltonization is an image manipulation algorithm that enables color blind people to differentiate between colors in the image.

Note: Daltonization is a work in progress. Algorithm tweaking is required.
